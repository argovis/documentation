Point Schema
============

All data indexed by Argovis which can be cast as *point data* - in general,  any piece of data attached to a set of spacetime coodinates - are represented by the JSON schema described in this document. Argovis' point data schema is *hierarchical*,  in that all such schema inherit from the base point data schema; this creates two main advantages:

 - By requiring all point data encode their common features like coordinates,  IDs and other universal metadata identically,  it is trivial to include new data products in co-location APIs that search on these parametes.
 - Flexibility to represent arbitrary point data is maintained by allowing subject matter experts for a given measurement class to extend the base point data schema with additional schema that represent their specific instrument or measurement.

In this way,  we try to capture the flexibility of schema-less databases like mongodb,  while imposing just enough structure to capture the data validation opportunities afforded by strictly defined schema.

How to read this schema
-----------------------

Each entry in the schema fragments below contain a few keys:

- **type:** the primitive type,  format,  or object description of a valid entry for this field
- **description:** short comment on what this variable is
- **fill value** (optional): what this should be filled by if absent
- **current vocabulary** (optional): current set of possible values for this key,  with explanations as required.

Schema enforcement & population
-------------------------------

All these schema are enforced via mongodb's built-in schema validation; those schema validation rules are defined in the ``pointSchema.py`` script at https://github.com/argovis/db-schema.

Once an empty ``point`` collection is generated by the script above, it is populated by pipelines that translate from the formats of upstream data providers, to mongodb-appropriate JSON that matches these schemas. Each schema extension section below contains links to the code backing these pipelines.


Base point data schema
----------------------

This section describes the base point data schema from which all other point data in Argovis *must* inherit.

  - **fill value:** -1,  used if reported lon/lat are on land.

- ``data_type``

  - **type:** string
  - **description:** token indicating the general class of data
  - **current vocabulary:** ``oceanicProfile``,  ``tropicalCyclone``

Optional Keys
+++++++++++++

All point data MAY include the following keys; if meaningful data is available for any of these keys,  it should be represented in the format described.

- ``country``

  - **type:** string
  - **description:** ISO 3166-1 country code.

- ``data``

  - **type:** array of non-nested JSON documents
  - **description:** array indexes depth / altitude; individual documents are key/value pairs describing measurements made. Pressure or altitude must be present as one of the document keys. Example: ``{pres: 4.7,  psal: 33.987,  temp: 1.107, temp_argoqc: 1}``
  - **current vocabulary:** defined per project,  see schema extensions below.

- ``data_center``

  - **type:** string
  - **description:** entity responsible for processing this record,  once received.

  - **description:** a complete list of all the keys found in any document in the ``data`` object.

- ``data_warning``

  - **type:** array of strings
  - **description:** short string tokens indicating possible problems with this record.
  - **current vocabulary:**
    - ``missing_location``: one or both of longitude and latitude are missing
    - ``degenerate_levels``: data is reported twice for a given pressure / altitude level in a way that cannot be readily resolved.
    - ``missing_basin``: unable to determine meaningful basin code,  despite having a meaningful lat / lon (edge case in basins lookup grid)

- ``doi``

  - **type:** string
  - **description:** DOI for this record.

  - **type:** string
  - **description:** string token describing the device used to make this measurement,  like ``profiling_float``,  ``ship_ctd`` etc.
